Zambia's second-order administrative divisions: 74 districts as of the 2010 census.

SHAPEFILES
The original shapefile downloaded from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction had 1,416 polygons and matched the 2010 census wards (fourth-order administrative divisions), after a change to the subnational boundaries by USCB staff:
(1) A total of five polygons were added by USCB staff to the original shapefile to match 2000 census wards. Polygons were created for Miluji in North-Western Province, Mumba in Central Province, Musonda in Luapula Province, Ipusukilo in Northern Province, and Katiula in Eastern Province.

This change resulted in a shapefile with 1,421 polygons, one for each of Zambia's fourth-order administrative divisions. The U.S. Census Bureau aligned the shapefile's national boundary to the Large Scale International Boundary Line (LSIB) polygon file from the U.S. Department of State, Office of the Geographer and Global Issues. Finally, the LSIB-aligned shapefile was dissolved into 74 polygons, one for each of Zambia's second-order administrative divisions (districts) as reported by the Zambia Central Statistical Office in the 2010 census.

CENSUS DATA INTERPOLATION
The 2000 census totals had the following differences in geography that have been modified to their 2010 locations in the estimates presented here, requiring interpolation and adjustment of 2000 population data by USCB staff:
(1) The total number of wards in Zambia increased from 1,286 at the time of the 2000 census, to 1,421 by the time of the 2010 census. These new wards were formed from parts of single or multiple existing wards, as noted in the "USCBCMNT" field.
(2) To interpolate the subnational boundary changes in Zambia that occurred between 2000 and 2010, shapefiles were used by USCB staff that matched the wards for each census year. According to these shapefiles, there were a number of wards in Zambia that moved locations entirely. For example, in Luapula Province, the area known as Muleshi Ward in 2010 was known as Lwingishi Ward in 2000, and the area known as Lwingishi Ward in 2010 was known as Chibeleka Ward in 2000. In addition, there were many other wards that changed size between census, but whose boundaries generally stayed in the same place. There were too many of these types of boundary changes to list, so the notes in the "USCBCMNT" field refer only to the newly formed wards mentioned above.
(3) Chowa and Ipumbu Wards in Copperbelt Province, Chadzombe Ward in Eastern Province, and Munyeke Ward in Southern Province ceased to exist sometime between the 2000 and 2010 censuses.

For new wards that were fully formed from part of a single area, where boundaries and population data were not available for the next administrative level down, the total population of the original area in 2000 was divided proportionally according to the populations of the new areas in 2010. For new wards that were formed from parts of multiple original areas, where boundaries and population data were not available for the next administrative level down, the total population of the new area in 2010 was divided proportionally according to the land areas of the multiple original pieces in square kilometers.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
(1) Single-year ages and the open-ended age group 95 years-and-older data for the national, first-, and second-order administrative divisions of Zambia were summed by USCB staff into 5-year age groups with an open-ended age group of 80 years-and-older.
(2) Age-sex data for the third- and fourth-order administrative divisions of Zambia were only available with an open-ended age group of 65 years-and-older. Values for the five-year age groups of 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, and 80 years-and-older, all by sex, for the third- and fourth-order administrative divisions were calculated by USCB staff by disaggregating the 65 years-and-older age group proportionally, according to their second-order administrative division totals.

FEATURE AND ATTRIBUTE DETAILS
The 2000-2025 population estimates for Zambia's administrative divisions are provided in the following two tables:
(1) The Unicode tab-delimited text file (table) "Zambia_5yr_age_sex_2000-2025_uscb_oct2021.txt," which can be joined to the shapefile via the common field "GEOMATCH."
(2) The Excel table "Zambia_5yr_age_sex_2000-2025_508_uscb_oct2021.xlsx," formatted for accessibility in compliance with Section 508 of the U.S. Government's Federal Rehabilitation Act.

Details on processing of the census data and calculation of 2000-2025 estimates are provided in the "Census Metadata" tab of the Excel file and "Methods for Calculating 5-Year Age Group Population Estimates by Sex for Subnational Areas" document. For the subnational areas, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) "approved" names from the NGA GEOnet Names Server (cited in the "Credits") were used. For any area that a BGN name was not available, the name from the national census was used. Official codes for the subnational areas from the country's national statistical office, when available, are entered in the "NSO_CODE" field in both the text and Excel tables. Information on any alternative area names or recent name or boundary changes is entered in the "USCBCMNT" field. A partial list of the fields in the Excel and Unicode text files, including all fields identifying geographic names and codes, is provided in the Excel file's "Data Dictionary" tab. More detail on the U.S. Census Bureau subnational age and sex group estimates and maps for PEPFAR can be found in the document "Subnational Population Estimates Components for the Spatial Data Repository." It includes a data dictionary that is similar to that in the Excel table.

ACCESS
The U.S. Census Bureau’s products for PEPFAR can be accessed from the Spatial Data Repository at http://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/home/, which also provides access to data and maps from the DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys) Program. A zipped file containing shapefiles with metadata, an Excel workbook with subnational population estimates, and a Unicode tab-delimited text file is available for each country. PEPFAR products are also available on the Census Bureau website at http://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/demo/international-programs/subnationalpopulation.html for download.</suppInfo><idPoC><rpIndName>Population Division</rpIndName><rpOrgName>U.S. Census Bureau</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress addressType="postal"><delPoint>4600 Silver Hill Rd</delPoint><city>Washington</city><adminArea>DC</adminArea><postCode>20233-8800</postCode><eMailAdd>pop.global.map.list@census.gov</eMailAdd><country>US</country></cntAddress></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="011">11</RoleCd></role><displayName>U.S. Census Bureau</displayName></idPoC><dataExt><geoEle xmlns=""><GeoBndBox esriExtentType="search"><exTypeCode Sync="TRUE">1</exTypeCode><westBL Sync="TRUE">21.999351</westBL><eastBL Sync="TRUE">33.709030</eastBL><northBL Sync="TRUE">-8.203284</northBL><southBL Sync="TRUE">-18.077498</southBL></GeoBndBox></geoEle></dataExt><tpCat><TopicCatCd value="016"/></tpCat><tpCat><TopicCatCd value="013"/></tpCat></dataIdInfo><mdMaint><maintFreq><MaintFreqCd value="009">9</MaintFreqCd></maintFreq></mdMaint><spatRepInfo><VectSpatRep><geometObjs Name="Zambia_adm2_uscb_2021"><geoObjTyp><GeoObjTypCd value="002" Sync="TRUE"></GeoObjTypCd></geoObjTyp><geoObjCnt Sync="TRUE">74</geoObjCnt></geometObjs><topLvl><TopoLevCd value="001" Sync="TRUE"></TopoLevCd></topLvl></VectSpatRep></spatRepInfo><refSysInfo><RefSystem dimension="horizontal"><refSysID><identCode code="4326"/><idCodeSpace Sync="TRUE">EPSG</idCodeSpace><idVersion Sync="TRUE">6.14(3.0.1)</idVersion></refSysID></RefSystem></refSysInfo><mdHrLvName Sync="TRUE">dataset</mdHrLvName><spdoinfo><ptvctinf><esriterm Name="Zambia_adm2_uscb_2021"><efeatyp Sync="TRUE">Simple</efeatyp><efeageom code="4" Sync="TRUE"></efeageom><esritopo Sync="TRUE">FALSE</esritopo><efeacnt Sync="TRUE">74</efeacnt><spindex Sync="TRUE">FALSE</spindex><linrefer Sync="TRUE">FALSE</linrefer></esriterm></ptvctinf></spdoinfo><mdContact><rpIndName>Population Division</rpIndName><rpOrgName>U.S. Census Bureau</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress addressType="postal"><delPoint>4600 Silver Hill Rd</delPoint><city>Washington</city><adminArea>DC</adminArea><postCode>20233-8800</postCode><eMailAdd>pop.global.map.list@census.gov</eMailAdd><country>US</country></cntAddress></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="011">11</RoleCd></role><displayName>U.S. Census Bureau</displayName></mdContact><Binary><Thumbnail><Data EsriPropertyType="PictureX">/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAAQABAAD/2wBDAAgGBgcGBQgHBwcJCQgKDBQNDAsLDBkSEw8UHRofHh0a
